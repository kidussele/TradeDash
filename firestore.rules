/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for TradeDash Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data,
 * as identified by their Firebase Auth UID. All data is nested under a user-specific path.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/trades/{tradeId}: Stores individual trade records for a user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own profiles.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own trade records.
 * - Listing all users or all trades across users is explicitly denied to prevent information leakage.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `userProfileId` field is used within the `Trade` document to ensure that only the owner of the user profile can access the trade information.
